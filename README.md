# Arduino-implementation-in-RC-car
Built a bluetooth remote controlled car using Arduino along with bluetooth module. Can be controlled through a Mobile application using virtual buttons or smartphoneâ€™s accelerometer.

Created functions to operate the motion of a RC car, motions include :
(1) Forward,
(2) Backward,
(3) Right sharp,
(4) Left sharp,
(5) Forward right,
(6) Forward left,
(7) Backward right, and
(8) Backward left.

Input :
Obtained from clicks performed on smartphone / accelerometer of the smartphone.

Output :
Given by the arduino at the specified ports, this output is then given to the 4 motors in the form of LOW/HIGH signal.
